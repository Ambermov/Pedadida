All synced together with one simple setup wizard.\r\n\r\n### Responsive Education\r\nSo, your students don't want to log in on their desktop and they'd rather do their homework on the bus ride home.

Works!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCoded by @krashnik in less than 3 days for version 1.0.
